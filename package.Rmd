<h3><strong>EpiILMCT: Continuous Time Distance-Based and Network-Based Individual Level Models for Epidemics</strong>:</h3>

The **R** package **EpiILMCT** provides tools for simulating from continuous-time individual level models of disease transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with the same models. The epidemic models considered are distance-based and contact network-based models within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed (SINR) compartmental frameworks.

<h3><strong>EpiILM: Spatial and Network Based Individual Level Models for Epidemics</strong>:</h3>

The **R** package **EpiILM** provides tools for simulating from discrete-time individual level models for infectious disease data analysis. This epidemic model class contains spatial and contact-network based models with two disease types: Susceptible-Infectious (SI) and Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR).
